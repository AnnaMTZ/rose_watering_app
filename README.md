# rose_watering_app

The application to remind my friend to water the rose in the case if it was not raining for more than 5 days.

The application uses async js to fetch weather api with GET method. 

Final goal of an application is to send an e-mail to my friend reminding to water the rose. 

At this point of time the app only fetches the current data and prints the message depending on the current weather. No styling is applied.
